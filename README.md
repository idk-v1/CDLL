# CDLL

This is my attempt at getting around school restrictions of not being able to run executable programs. The project file included is set to generate a .dll file. The 'DLL.h' file is to make the main file look normal. If it compiles, but can't start the program that means it worked! (DLLs can't run directly) Run the 'Run.py' script to test your program. The 'Run.py' script is not hard coded to any one project, so it can be copy pasted and will work. For some reason only Python's DLL runner works. (Autohotkey and RUNDLL32.exe do not work)

The example program creates a window proving that we can get the full C++ experience. The SFML library may need to be modified in order to work.
